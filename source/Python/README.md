# EOS SDK IP Monitor - Python

#### Version 1.4
Introduced a .swix install for the Python version of the agent.

#### Version 1.3
##### Features
- Added logging outputs that shows when optional parameter options are updated/changed.  Showing previous value to new value.
```
Oct  1 12:28:29 veos-rtr-01 myIP-MON: %myIP-6-LOG: VRF value changed from default to ns-MGMT
```
- Added functionality to reset optional parameters to default by performing a `no` command. Below are examples for resetting each optional parameter to default:
```
config
daemon IpMon
no poll
no threshold
no email
no vrf
no srouce
end
```

##### Fixes
- Corrected an issue where if an IP address was inputed incorrectly for a device, updating the IP address wouldn't take the new IP.
- Corrected a logging issue where it would produe a `failed over X times` even though the failed count didn't reach that mark

#### Version 1.2
- Corrected an incorrect setting of the email parameter.  It was causing email functionality to fail.

#### Version 1.1
- Corrected an issue where the script only monitored the first device/IP address entered in, and ignores the remaining entered ones

#### Version 1.0
Inital release of the code.

## Switch Setup
1. Copy `IpMon` and `profileIP` to `/mnt/flash/` on the switch
2. Run the following command on the switch: 
```
bash /mnt/flash/./profileIP
```
3. In EOS config mode perform the following commands for basic functionality (see step #4 for further customization):
```
config
daemon IpMon
exec /mnt/flash/IpMon
no shutdown
```
4. By default, the agent has the following default values in terms of polling:
- Polling interval = 10 seconds
- Trigger threshold = 3 consecutive failed attempts
- VRF = default (VRF used on the switch by default)

To modify the default behavior, use the following commands to override the defaults:
```
config
daemon IpMon
option poll value {time_in_seconds}
option threshold value {number_of_failures}
option email value {email_address}
option vrf value {vrf_name}
option source value {source_intf}
```
**`time_in_seconds` **(optional)** how much time the agent should wait until it tries to poll the IP addresses*

***`number_of_failures` **(optional)** how many failures should occur consecutively before an action is triggered*

****`email_address` **(required for email alerting)** the email address for the agent to send an alert if the threshold has been reached*

****For email functionality to work, a working SMTP server needs to be setup on the switch to send emails*

*****`vrf_name` **(optional)** the name of the VRF that the pings should originate from (VRF name is case-sensitive)*

******`source_intf` **(optional)** interface to source ping from. ie `et44, et49_1, ma1, vlan100` See conversion list below for interface mappings*

##### Interface Mappings
- et44 --> Ethernet44
- et49_1 --> Ethernet49/1
- ma1 --> Management1
- vlan100 --> Vlan100

5. In order for this agent to monitor IP addresses, the following commands will need to be taken:
```
config
daemon IpMon
option {device_name} value {ip_of_device}
```
**`device_name` needs to be a unique identifier for each remote switch/device*

**`ip_of_device` needs to be a valid IPv4 address for the remote device for monitoring*

***To see what unique peer identifiers have been created, enter `show daemon IpMon`*

Example of a full `daemon IpMon` config would look like with all parameters specified
```
config
daemon IpMon
option cvx-01 value 192.168.50.16
option poll value 15
option threshold value 5
option email value test@domain.com
option vrf value MGMT
option source value vlan100
no shutdown
```
6. To make this agent persist a reboot/power-cycle.  We will need to create a `rc.eos` file in the `/mnt/flash` directory of the switch.  The contents for `rc.eos` are as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash
/mnt/flash/./profileIP
```

#### Sample output of `show daemon IpMon`
```

#### Signs of an Error
In the below log output, a tell-tale sign that there is an error are repeated `IPMON Agent Initialized` logs:
```
Sep 28 11:33:25 veos-rtr-01 myIP-MON: %AGENT-6-INITIALIZED: Agent 'IpMon-IpMon' initialized; pid=14232

Sep 28 11:33:34 veos-rtr-01 myIP-MON: %myIP-6-LOG: IPMON Agent Initialized
```

If this occurs, check to make sure any optional configuration parameters are correct.
